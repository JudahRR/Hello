# Hello

Sometimes you are somewhere and want to message someone but you can't quite do it. Well, no worries, Hello gots your back. Here how you do it:

```var hello = new Hello()```

Do I have to do all the PHP, Ajax, MySQL, and MySQLI. Nope, Hello handles that too all in the ```new Hello()``` function.

If I wanted to make a Hello Messaging Program this is what I would do.
```
var hello = new Hello();
hello.width(// You can set it to whatever you want and if you leave it empty it will set it on default);
hello.height(// You can set it to whatever you want and if you leave it empty it will set it on default);
hello.place('bottom-right');
```
We do the work so you don't have to.
